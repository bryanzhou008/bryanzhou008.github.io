I am currently an undergraduate student at University of California, Los Angeles. My academic interests fall in the subjects of Algorithms, Machine Learning, NLP, Data Analytics and Optimization. I am actively looking for research opportunities in related areas. Here is my latest [CV](/files/Yu Zhou CV.pdf).

I have worked as an undergraduate researcher at [Knowledge Engineering Group - Tsinghua University](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) in 2021. Before that, I was a research intern at the [Structures-Computer Interaction Laboratory - UCLA](https://structures.computer/) under [Prof. M. Khalid Jawed](http://www.khalidjawed.com/). 

I finished high school at No.1 Middle School Attached to CCNU in Wuhan China. I am happy to get to meet friends from anywhere around the world. If you wish to contact me for any reason, please go ahead and [email me](mailto:admin@cloudhadoop.com).
