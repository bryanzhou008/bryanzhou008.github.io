I am currently an undergraduate student at University of California, Los Angeles. My academic interests fall in the subjects of Optimization, Machine Learning Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing. 

I am actively looking for research opportunities in related areas. Here is my latest [CV](/files/Yu Zhou CV.pdf).


I have worked as an undergraduate researcher at the [Knowledge Engineering Group - Tsinghua University](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) in 2021. Before that, I was a research intern at the [Structures-Computer Interaction Laboratory - UCLA](https://structures.computer/) under [Prof. M. Khalid Jawed](http://www.khalidjawed.com/). 

I am happy to get to meet friends from anywhere around the world. If you wish to contact me, please go ahead and [email me](mailto:admin@cloudhadoop.com).
