Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an undergraduate student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am broadly interested in **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** under the machine learning context. 



During summer 2022, I interned at [Prof. Heng Ji's Lab](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji/research.html) at UIUC.Previously, I have worked as an undergraduate researcher at the [Knowledge Engineering Group - Tsinghua University](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) in 2021. Before that, I was a research intern at the [Structures-Computer Interaction Laboratory - UCLA](https://structures.computer/) under [Prof. M. Khalid Jawed](http://www.khalidjawed.com/). 

     

For summer 2023, I am actively looking for research internship opportunities! Please [email me](mailto:bryanzhou008@g.ucla.edu) at bryanzhou008 [AT] ucla [DOT] com. Here is my [CV](/files/Yu Zhou CV.pdf) for your reference.
