In this article, we investigate state of the art object detection algorithms and their implementations in MMDetection. We write an up-to-date guide for setting up and running MMDetection on a structured COCO-2017 dataset in Google Colab based on our experience. We analyse and classify the key component structure (detection head/neck/backbone) of MMdetection models. After which, we reproduce the object detection task for popular models on main-stream benchmarks including the COCO-2017 dataset and construct a datailed interactive table. In the last part of our work, we use signature object detection algorithms on real-live photos and videos taken at UCLA campus and provide error analysis. Finally, we perform basic adversarial attacks on our models using representave photos and evaluate their effects.
