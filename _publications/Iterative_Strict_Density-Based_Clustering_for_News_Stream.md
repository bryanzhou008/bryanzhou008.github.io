News Streams are booming with the prosperity of the Internet, leading to increased demand for an efficient and effective news clustering method. Since news reports vary greatly in different countries, languages and news-topics, clustering diverse news has proven to be a big challenge for all researchers. The results of current clustering methods expose their inability to detect fine-grained topics. They tend to detect topics on a coarse-grained scale, resulting in clustering different fine-grained topics together.In this paper, we propose Iterative Strict Density-based Clustering (ISDC), a new approach for detecting fine-grained topics in an evolving news stream. The main idea of ISDC is to keep every cluster as a high-density cluster throughout the news stream by iteratively splitting growing clusters. We further apply multilingual-sentence-bert instead of word embedding as the news encoder to improve the news representation quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
