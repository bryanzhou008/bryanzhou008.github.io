In order to estimate qualitatively the influence of nonequilibrium evolution in relativistic heavy ion collisions, we use the three dimensional Ising model with Metropolis algorithm to study the evolution from nonequilibrium to equilibrium on the phase boundary. The evolution of order parameter approaches its equilibrium value exponentially, the same as that given by Langevin equation. The average relaxation time is defined which is demonstrated to well represent the relaxation time in dynamical equations. It is shown that the average relaxation time at critical temperature diverges as the zth power of system size. The third and the fourth cumulants of order parameter during the nonequilibrium evolution could be either positive or negative, depending on the observation time, consistent with dynamical models at T > Tc. It is found that the nonequilibrium evolution at T > Tc lasts very short, and the influence is weaker than that at T < Tc. Those qualitative features are instructive to determine experimentally the critical point and the phase boundary of QCD.
